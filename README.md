# fallout-terminal-minigame
This project is my attempt to clone the terminal hacking minigame found in the Fallout games. 
The goal of the project is so I can learn JavaScript/get better at coding.
### The rules of the game
* guess a password from a list of words on the screen.
* the game will tell you how many letters of your guessed word is correct
* using that information you can make a more informed guess
* you only have 3 chances to select the correct password
* if you select the correct password within 3 tries you unlock the PC 
* congratulations! You are now a hacker!

### Project Updates
* version 1.0 - initial commit of old code. Game is functional using a small amount of words.

### Future updates: 
* import huge list of common 7 letter words
* typing animation for selected word hover
* typing sound for selected word hover
* improved css styling
